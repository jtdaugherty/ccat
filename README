ccat is a tool that behaves a little bit like 'cat', but will try to
guess what kind of data it is processing and perform syntax
highlighting on it.  If ccat can't figure out what kind of syntax
highlighting to apply, it just outputs the data without performing
processing.

cless is a shell script to invoke less with ASCII color escape
preservation so you can use 'ccat' with 'less'.

ccat requires Python 2.6 and Pygments.

To install Pygments, you'll want something like:

  - sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
  - sudo easy_install-2.6 pygments
